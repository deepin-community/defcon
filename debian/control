Description: UFO based objects for use in font editing applications
 Defcon is a set of UFO based objects optimized for use in font
 editing applications. The objects are built to be lightweight, fast
 and flexible. The objects are very bare-bones and they are not meant
 to be end-all, be-all objects. Rather, they are meant to provide base
 functionality so that you can focus on your application’s behavior,
 not object observing or maintaining cached data. Defcon implements
 UFO3 as described by the UFO font format.
